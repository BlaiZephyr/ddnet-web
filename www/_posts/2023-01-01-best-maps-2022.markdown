Happy new year everyone!

Our entire DDNet team would like to wish you all a warm and safe journey throughout 2023. DDNet grew again massively this year and we welcomed many newcomers to the community. We hope that you will all continue enjoying your time on DDNet while we continue to serve the community and find new ways to enrich your experience in 2023.

Here's to an awesome 2023!

What were your favorite maps of 2022? [bencie](/players/bencie/) made the effort to set up a [voting system for all maps released in 2022](https://forum.ddnet.org/viewforum.php?f=130). There's a poll for each difficulty, including a separate category for the Advent of DDNet 2022 Event!

We look forward to seeing what new creations our community will make this year!
