DDNet is running an Advent of DDNet event starting tomorrow until the last door opens on December 24:

Finish the (already released) map behind each door on the assigned day to land on the leaderboard. Doors are opened at 00:00 CET and have to be finished within 24 hours. Best finish time gets 20 points, second 19 points and so on with a minimum of 10 points just for finishing. The points are accumulated for the entire time from December 1 to December 24 and don't count outside of this event.
The results will be available on the [results page](https://ddnet.org/tournaments/advent2022/).

Thanks to [heinrich5991](/players/heinrich5991/) for the idea for this event!
