Thanks to [louis](https://ddnet.org/mappers/louis/) we have a "DDNet New Year Photoshoot 2023" server again with a fresh map for 2023! Also thanks to [TsFreddie](https://github.com/TsFreddie) for the server [modification](https://github.com/TeeworldsCN/MomentCap). Everyone can join the New Year Photshoot server running now to be part of the community photo! Check out [last year's result](https://ddnet.org/newyear2022/) too.
