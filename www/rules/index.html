<div class="block">
<h2 id="mapping-rules">Mapping Rules</h2>
<p>If you want your map to be released on DDNet, you must follow these rules. Before you submit your map on <a href="/discord/">DDNet Discord</a>, make sure it is already thoroughly tested by you and your friends, parts work smoothly, and the design is finished!</p>
<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There has to be enough space in parts for comfortable movement.</li>
  <li>There can't be large spikes in difficulty.</li>
  <li>In parts where it's easy to fail, there should be ways to recover.</li>
  <li>Parts can't be excessively precise or punishing only to increase the difficulty.</li>
  <li>Special tiles can't be overused, used if they're not needed or used to fix cheats.</li>
  <li>Gameplay can't be intentionally misleading or confusing.</li>
  <li>Parts can't use bugs that exploit game physics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visuals:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Every tile that players need to know about has to be clearly marked.</li>
  <li>Different tiles and markings have to be easy to tell apart.</li>
  <li>There has to be a clear distinction between foreground and background elements.</li>
  <li>Contrast and saturation shouldn't be too high so the map isn't an eyesore.</li>
  <li>Signs, hints and warnings have to be marked using the "Turn Off Entities" tile.</li>
  <li>If custom elements from another map are used, the original creator needs to give permission.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All tees have to cross the startline.</li>
  <li>Every map has to have time checkpoints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>While unique and creative parts are important, good level design is even more so. A simple map with solid level design and nice visuals has a better chance to get released than a complex one with problems.</p>
